       <h3><u>Hi, I'm Ally</u></h3>
        I am 13 years old, living in Oregon. My life consists of mostly studying hobbies. I do well in school and have been studying a lot over the summer. Here's what I've been up to:
        <p>
           <ul style= "list-style: none;" style = "margin: 30px">
                <li><b>3D printing-</b> <p>
                    Last Christmas, my parents got me my own monoprice printer. Ever since, I've been studying sketch-up and printing other peoples' designs. It's truly satisfying to pry a new print off the printing bed. Lately, I've learned the basics of fusion and was happy to find that Fusion was a lot easier to operate than sketch-up. I will use Fusion from now on.</li>
                <li><b>Language-</b><p>
                    Over the summer, I've been working a lot on French. I want to be a multi-language speaker so that it will benefit me in the future. I want to work globally. Learning French has really changed my perspective of the English language and I'm looking forward to exploring deeper.</li>
                <li><b>Mathematics-</b><p>
                    Over the summer, I checked out some math books from the library and have been studying a lot. Math is very calming and I really enjoy having a good challenge. There's so much math out there to learn, it makes me so happy to think about. I'm in very advanced math classes but sometimes it's nice to venture off into other mathematical topics.</li>
                <li><b>Music-</b><p>
                    Music is my love. I've been playing piano for four years, flute for two years and have just begun on clarinet. I have ukuleles, guitars and a harp and am somewhat familiar with them. My mom has a violin that I've been thinking about a lot. My absolute favorite music is the soundtracks from La La Land which I am currently learning on piano.</li>
                <li><b>Running-</b><p>
                    I don't run often over the summer, but I love it. It makes me feel like an important person. I wish I were stronger because the push-up tests in PE are very embarressing when you can only do two. But running has always been enjoyable to me and I will continue to try harder.</li>
                <li><b>Pocket Watch Renewal-</b><p>
                    Not long ago, my Dad bought me a big box of broken and competely rusted pocket watches. I fell in love with them and am on my way to bringing them back to life. There's not many sources out the for learning how to fix pocket watches, oddly, but nothing's going to stop me.</li>
                <li><b>Robotics-</b><p>
                    Last year in school, I made one of the three members of my FTC robotics competition team. I was the only girl. Sadly, we weren't able to go to competition because we didn't start at the right time and that lost all advantage. But our robot (whom my teamates named Toby) was wonderful. Also, when I was younger, I did bot fighting in a camp. I never lost those fights because I built up more advantages. Very fun. I'm very competitive in that feild.</li>
                <li><b>And of course, coding-</b><p>
                    I love coding. Earlier this week, I learned the basics of python, You wouldn't have beleived how happy I was to finally not be scared of it's complexity. It's fascinating. I also know HTML but it's not nearly as fun. If you want to see a game I programmed in scratch, go <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/170903465/#fullscreen" > here </a> </li>
             </ul>  
        </p>
            Well that's about it in my life. The one thing I find most amazing is that practice makes perfect. You can literally do anything as long as you practice! Isn't that just a miracle?! You could do a backflip, touch your toes, fly a jet, there are no limits. That's why I love to simply practice. Because not only do I enjoy practicing, but it makes me BETTER! That concept makes me want to do everything to be honest. So don't let anything hold you back from what you want.
